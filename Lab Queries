Table
- This command will only display the JSession ID, price and product name
	
	index=web sourcetype=access* status=200 product_name=* | table JSESSIONID,price,product_name


Rename
- This command is used to rename fields. If using a phrase as a new field name, wrap the new name in quotes

	index=web sourcetype=access* status=200 product_name=* | table JSESSIONID,price,product_name | 
	rename JSESSIONID as “User Session”

Dedup
- Removes events with duplicate values
- The following command will remove duplicate entries of the user name by their first and last names

	index=security sourcetype=history* Address_Description=“San Francisco” | dedup Username | 
	table Username First_Name Last_Name

Sort
- Sorts results in ascending or descending order
- Sort on two fields

	sourcetype=vendor_sales | table Vendor product_name sale_price | sort Vendor product_name

- By default a field will be displayed in ascending order. This can also be indicated by the + sign. The following command sorts by the sale_price and Vendor. 

	sourcetype=vendor_sales | table Vendor product_name sale_price | sort + sale_price Vendor

- The placement of the +/- affects the fields to search on. If there is a space between the +/- operators and the fields to sort on, both fields will be affected. If there is no space, only the field directly behind the +/- is affected. 

- We can also limit the number of events with the limit command

	sourcetype=vendor_sales | table Vendor product_name sale_price | sort + sale_price Vendor limit=20

Top

- Finds common values in given fields
- The following query displays the top vendors by count…searches are limited to 10 by default
    - index=sales sourcetype=vendor_sales | top Vendor
    - add limit=0 for all results, limit=20 for the top etc.
- Searches can be done on multiple fields as well.
    - index=sales sourcetype=vendor_sales | top Vendor product_name limit=0
- Clauses can be used with the top command to change the count and percentage columns or to not show them at all
    - Command Clauses
        - limit=int
        - countfield=string
        - percentfield=string
        - showcount=True/False

Lookups
- Lookups allow you to add other fields and values to your events not included in the indexed data.
    - csv files, scripts, geospatial data
- To create a lookup file: define a lookup table and define the lookup.
- Lookup files are case sensitive.
- To verify a look up is working pipe the file into the inputlookup command
    - index=web sourcetype=access_combined NOT status=200 | lookup http_status code as status, OUTPUT code as “HTTP Code”, description as “HTTP Description”
