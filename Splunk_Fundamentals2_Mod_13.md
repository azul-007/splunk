### Root Datasets
------------

Data models are creating by going to Settings -> Data models -> New Data Model

1. Create a root event: under the add data set drop down. We can either create a Root Event or a Root Search. A **root event** enables you to create hierachies based on 
a set of events, and are the most commonly used type of root data model object. A **root search** builds these hierarchies from a transforming search. Root searches do not benefit from data model accelaration. It is suggested to avoid using root searches whenever possible.
